INF-C assembler v1.0

uhh welcome to the infernum assembler for the.. infernum cyzure

firstly im bad at naming things
second im bad at making things

Firstly to use the code in INF-C Constructor
go ahead and download it and put it somewhere in your computer, then accordingly fix all of the filepaths (tedious but its only like 10 minutes or less )

now that your files are setup you may now use them in this order

precompiler
\/
assembler
\/
assembly
\/
translate
(the translate file's x and y must be the start of 0,0 FILT pixel on the INF-C machine sid of things)

then now knowing this you may scroll around in the assembler.lua file to find the opcodes you need

note: only COUT is the existing I/O variable
if you wanna add more opcodes feel free to make a pull request lol
